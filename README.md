# F1 API by Valdevz

F1 API is the first free API to get Formula1 data, this is the first version, so this version just have the constructors and pilots data of this season (2022).

## IMPORTANT

This is only the code that I used to deploy de project, but doesn't have access to the db where the information is located.

To use this API go to [https://api-f1.herokuapp.com/v1/api/](https://api-f1.herokuapp.com/v1/api/) to see the documentation.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/page) to install f1-api-expressjs, just clone the project and then execute in your folder terminal.

```bash
npm install 
```
Then in your .env file write your DATABASE_HOST (this project is set up with MongoDB)
